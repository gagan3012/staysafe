82% percent of women have indicated that they have faced some form of harassment in the workplace, but only 19% percent of cases have been reported. 

This happens primarily because of the embarrassment of reporting. But what if there was a way to prevent this embarrassment and while simultaneously allow the authorities to check in with the person reporting!
